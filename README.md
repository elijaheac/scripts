# My Scripts
I use these scripts for my Linux setups. This repo was initialized from my /usr/local/bin directory on Arch and may need tweaking for other distros.

To install, run `update-scripts` after cloning the repository, or run the following command:

`sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elijaheac/scripts/master/update-scripts)"`
